	Introductory comments:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This term introduces hot dog theory
		\item Next term, we will take a look at elementary hamburger theory
		\item Applications include barbeques (BBQ) and similar
			culinary settings
		\item Homework due every two weeks
		\item Final exam is take-home
	\end{itemize}

	\section{Preliminaries}

		\begin{dfn}
			A \emph{hot dog} is an ordered triple $\cal H=(s,\beta,C)$
			consisting of a sausage $s\in\Sigma$ equipped with an associated
			bun $\beta\in\cal B$,
			and a subset $C\subset\text{Cond}\,(\Sigma)$
			of condiments which allow fixation to saugages of class $\Sigma$,
			such that $s$ is contained in the first-order wedge of $\beta$.
			That is, $s\in\bf{w}^1(\beta)$.
		\end{dfn}

	\section{Review of Soup Theory}

		\begin{thm}
			[Cereal inclusion principle]
			Suppose that $B$ is a bowl of (breakfast) cereal
			and there exists $\sigma,\tau\in(0,1)$ such that the
			milk-proportion $p_B$ associated
			to $B$  satisfies $\sigma\leq p_B\leq \tau$.
			Then $B$ is a bowl of soup.
		\end{thm}

	\section{Boyardee's ravioli lemma}

		A \emph{ravioli} is hot dog whose bun wedge is an internal cavity
		and whose condiments are elements of $\cal{T}\oplus\cal{P}$,
		that is, the condiments consist of linear combinations of
		tomato sauce and pesto.

		\begin{lem}
			[Boyardee's ravioli lemma]
			Suppose $\cal H$ is a ravioli.
			Then the condiments of $\cal H$ can be partitioned into
			interior and exterior sauces.
		\end{lem}

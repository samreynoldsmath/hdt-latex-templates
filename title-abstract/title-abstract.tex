\begin{abstract}
	Noodlemorphisms were introduced by Boyardee and Crunch 1973 as a method of constructing pasta chain complexes which preserve certain sauce properties. In this talk, we present a new method of constructing noodlemorphisms using the theory of invariant spaghetti cohomologies. We then use a lemma of McDonald and Sanders to show that the Bourdain-Puck conjecture holds whenever the spaghetti cohomology of the pasta chain complex is pesto-invariant or is a subcomplex of the alfredo cohomology. This is joint work with Guy Fieri.
